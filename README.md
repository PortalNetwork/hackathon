[Continuously updating]

Portal Network is honored to be inviting our partners to Hackathon Korea. We welcome everyone to participate and solve challenges by using different decentralized technologies.

# Hackthon Summary

## Introduction of Portal Network

[Our Blog](https://medium.com/portalnetworkofficial)

[Our Github](https://github.com/PortalNetwork)

This is a guide to let you know more about Portal Network. You can use our tools to build a decentralized website/application that is hosted on blockchain name service.

## What is this Hackathon about?
Cryptocurrency and blockchain technology have definitely become one of the top trending topics last year. However, more than 90% of the people in this industry are traders and investors. It seems that most of the people are ignoring the technology behind that made bitcoin and all other cryptocurrencies possible. Portal Network values the technology behind the scene, so in order to foster this decentralized technology, Portal Network and its partners welcome anyone to join this Hackathon.

Participants will solve the challenges by utilizing different technologies provided in the event. People who have been in blockchain might have noticed that decentralized technology still has lots of challenges to overcome, such as scalability, security and so on. This Hackathon will be the time to try and test its limit.

*By participating the Hackathon Korea by Portal Network, you are agreeing to all the terms and rules stated below.

## Rules
During the hackathon, 3 technologies will be used:
1. Portal Network - decentralized domain name service and web builder
2. Bluzelle - decentralized database
3. Noia Network - decentralized content delivery network (CDN)

Additionally, 3 different smart contract platforms will be used:
1. Ethereum
2. Ethereum Classic
3. Wanchain

Participants will have a challenge to solve by applying the relevant blockchain technology. At the end of the event, each team will have to prepare a pitch on stage to demonstrate their idea or product, which will be scored by the judges (please see Judging section below for more information).

Participants can work as an individual (team of 1 person) or in a group (team of 2 - 5 people). Pitching time is to be decided on the day depending on the number of participants.

### Portal Network

Portal Network connects ENS, ECNS and WNS, and provides distributed, open, and extensible naming system based on smart contract platforms.

### Noia Network

Noia is a decentralized content delivery network for the new internet.

### IPFS

IPFS is a peer-to-peer hypermedia protocol that makes the web faster, safer, and transparent.

### Bluzelle

Bluzelle brings together the sharing economy and token economy. Bluzelle enables people to rent out their computer storage space to earn a token while dApp developers pay tokens in return.

### Pledgecamp

Pledgecamp uses blockchain technology to promote trust and cooperation between backers and creators.

## Hackathon Challenge Description

Portal Network Hackathon Challenge contains two requirements: technical, and an adaptable business model.

### 1. Technical Requirement

Participants should utilize the technologies provided

#### Challenge Detail

Portal Network provides the modern dApp framwework which contains the decentralized technology that includes Noia, Bluzelle, and IPFS.

Teams may use the dApp framework to implement their own ideas, and deploy it onto Portal Network's system. You'll get the corresponding IPFS link and the wanchain name service.

Here is the guide:
- Use our react-truffle-metamask framework, or choose your favorite dapp framework
    - The repo link :
    [https://github.com/PortalNetwork/react-truffle-metamask](https://github.com/PortalNetwork/react-truffle-metamask)
    - This frameworks contain the following integrations :
        1. React & Redux
        2. Truffle
        3. Bluzelle
        4. Web3
        5. MetaMask
- Use our hackathon uploader to deploy your project: [http://h2.portal.network](http://h2.portal.network)

- Access your decentralized website/application by using our browser extension: [Link](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/portal-network/apcnffelpkinnpoapmokieojaffmcpmf?utm_source=chrome-ntp-icon)

### 2. Business Model Requirement

This Hackathon is not only about the blockchain technology, but also about implementing it into real application. Thus, ideas established on a workable business model will be the second requirement for this Hacakthon.

#### Pledgecamp

Pledgecamp utilizes the blockchain technology to improve the efficency and trust issue within the current crowdfunding system. In this Hackathon, imagine you are a creator building a project that will be posted on Pledgecamp. Prepare a pitch that can effectively communicate your projects to the backers.

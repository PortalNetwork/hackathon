# Hackthon Summary

This is a guide to let you know more about Portal Network and Bitcoin Cash(BCH). You can use our tools to build a decentralized website/application which hosted on blockchain name service.

## Introduction of Bitcoin Cash
Bitcoin Cash is a fork from the Bitcoin, with core difference on its block size. Each block size is increased from 1MB to 8MB in order to process the increasing transaction volume. It also removed SegWit, an adjustment designed to free up block space by removing certain parts of the transaction.

With Bitcoin Cash, traders can trade at a lower cost and higher transaction volume, which potentially opens up rooms for more commercial usage.

## What is this Hackathon about?
Cryptocurrency and blockchain technology have definitely become one of the top trending topics last year. However, more than 90% of the people in this industry are traders and investors. It seems that most of the people are ignoring the technology behind that made bitcoin and all other cryptocurrencies possible. Portal Network values the technology behind the scene, so in order to foster this decentralized technology, Portal Network and its partners welcome anyone to join this Hackathon.

## Rules
During the hackathon, 3 technologies will be used:

- Portal Network - Blockchain name service and web builder.
- Bitcoin Cash - Bitcoin Cash Blockchain.
- Wormhole - Wormhole is a fast, portable Omni Layer implementation that is based off the Bitcoin Cash.

Participants will have a challenge to solve by applying the relevant blockchain technology. At the end of the event, each team will have to prepare a pitch on stage to demonstrate their idea or product, which will be scored by the judges (please see Judging section below for more information).

Participants can work as an individual (team of 1 person) or in a group (team of 2 - 5 people). Pitching time is to be decided on the day depending on the number of participants.

## Technology

Portal Network includes several technologies into our ecosystem.

Technology               | Project
-------------------------|:-------------------------------------
Blockchain               | [Bitcoin Cash](https://www.bitcoincash.org/)
Wormhole                 | [Wormhole](https://github.com/copernet/wormhole)
Domain Name Service      | [Portal Network](https://www.portal.network/)
File Storage             | [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/)

## Bitcoin Cash
Bitcoin Cash is an experimental digital currency that enables instant payments to anyone, anywhere in the world. It uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried out collectively by the network. Bitcoin Cash is a descendant of Bitcoin. It became a separate currency from the version supported by Bitcoin Core when the two split on August 1, 2017. Bitcoin Cash and the Bitcoin Core version of Bitcoin share the same transaction history up until the split.

## Wormhole
Wormhole is a fast, portable Omni Layer implementation that is based off the Bitcoin ABC codebase (currently 0.17.2). This implementation requires no external dependencies extraneous to Bitcoin ABC, and is native to the Bitcoin Cash network just like other Bitcoin Cash nodes. It currently supports a wallet mode and is seamlessly available on three platforms: Windows, Linux and Mac OS. Wormhole Cash Layer extensions are exposed via the JSON-RPC interface. Development has been consolidated on the Wormhole product, and it is the reference client for the Wormhole Cash Layer.

## Portal Network
Portal Network connects ENS, ECNS, WNS and BCNS, and provides distributed, open, and extensible naming system based on smart contract platforms.

## IPFS
IPFS is a peer-to-peer hypermedia protocol that makes the web faster, safer, and transparent.

## Hackathon Challenge Description

Portal Network Hackathon Challenge contains two requirements: technical, and an adaptable business model.

### 1. Technical Requirement

Participants should utilize the technologies provided

#### Challenge Detail

Portal Network provides the modern dApp framwework which contains and utilized BNS and IPFS.

Teams may build a dApp utilized dApp framework to implement their own ideas, and deploy it through Portal Network platform. You'll get the corresponding IPFS link and the Bitcoin Cash Name Service with your dApp.

### 2. Business Model Requirement

This Hackathon is not only about the blockchain technology, but also about implementing it into real application. Thus, ideas established on a workable business model will be the second requirement for this Hacakthon.

## Judging Criteria
1. Utilization of the Blockchain technology provided (25%) :

    How well suited is the product or concept for the Blockchain technology? Is Blockchain and token really needed for this concept?

2. The originality of the concept (25%) : 
    
    How innovative is the concept in solving this challenge? Is the concept unique?
3. The business model and marketing strategy (blockchain crowdfunding) (20%) :
    
    Is the business model suited for this idea? How much impact will this marketing strategy bring?
4. Pitch / Presentation (20%) :
    
    Presentation style and design.
5. Participants’ votes (10%) :

    Each participating team will have a vote for their favorite project (cannot vote for themselves).

## Judges

**More judges to be updated.**
